Example of my work..

https://www.consucredito.com/ - Php, Js, Html, Css, MySQL\
100% built from scratch, also have an admin section

https://astararetail.cl/ - Php, Js, Html, Css, MySQL\
All the ui that isnt static, and like 80% of backend logic: compare car, bookings, cars data, loaders, etc..

https://www.academiaadity.cl/ - Php, Js, Html, Css, MySQL\
Didnt touch frontend, coded some components to extract billings and report an electronic invoice, custom php functions, custom js injections for validations.

https://certificados.adity.digital/login - Php, Js, Html, Css, MySQL\
Backend 100% from scratch, I used a template for the frontend and modify it, this is the admin section for certificates of students.
ie: https://certificados.adity.digital/view?cert=2ffddd092d3550a4132ed8aabee44d5b \
The certificate is rendered in real time and can be downloaded in pdf and shared it in social media, also its integrated with linkedin to add it automatically.

https://aspromedica.com/plataforma/auth - C#, Php, Js, Html, Css, MySQL, OracleDb \n
I built a reports plattform, they didnt wanted all the data in the cloud..
I built an ETL in C# because raw data is in oracle db, then create a mysql Db locally to store the result of ETL avoiding to touch the principal DB.
They had the reports in excel, they wanted to look exactly the same and I achieved it.
